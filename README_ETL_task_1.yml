#Documentation for ETL_task_1
### last updated 30 July 2021

## Description
This program joins 3 tables about a hypothetical organization's consituents to yield a CSV file named "people", which 
contains columns for each constituent's email address, date of their file creation, date of their file modification,
the source of the constituent's account (google, facebook, organic, etc), and their email subscription status.

## Installation
Make sure the following CSV files are in your working directory before running the program

Constituent Information: https://als-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/fake_data/2020-07-01_17%3A11%3A00/cons.csv
Constituent Email Addresses: https://als-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/fake_data/2020-07-01_17%3A11%3A00/cons_email.csv
Constituent Subscription Status: https://als-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/fake_data/2020-07-01_17%3A11%3A00/cons_email_chapter_subscription.csv

## Future Updates
This file could be improved by taking the most recent modification datetime from the joined dataframe instead
of simply pulling the modification datetime from cons.csv.
